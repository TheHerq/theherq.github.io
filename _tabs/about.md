First of all, I would like to mention that since my native language is Polish, some posts will be written in Polish while others will be in English. Since most browsers have built-in translation features, this shouldn't be an issue.

I chose this approach because certain topics are easier and faster for me to write about in my native language, while others require English (as Polish translations sometimes sound off to me).

If, while reading this, you have any ideas or think that mixing languages creates confusion, please feel free to let me know, either by leaving a comment or sending me an email.

I have a wide range of interests and often jump from one topic to another, so this blog might sometimes feel like a collection of random thoughts or how-to guides.

I decided to create this blog primarily for myself and my close ones, but if you find something interesting or useful here, that will be an added satisfaction for me.

If any posts touch upon financial markets, including cryptocurrencies or other economic topics, please remember that I am not a financial advisor, and none of these posts should be considered investment advice. These are merely my personal, sometimes subjective reflections, which may be inaccurate.

The world around us is changing very rapidly, so my posts might quickly become outdated and turn into more of a historical record.

Please treat these posts as inspiration for your own thoughts rather than as advice.

Some posts will be written as instructional guides, primarily for myself, as I often find myself forgetting how I configured or calculated something in the past and need to search for the information again.

This blog is meant to serve as a reflection of my perspective on various phenomena and events happening around me, with which I sometimes interact.
